# Jupyter Hub
[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users access to computational environments and resources without burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks. Users - including students, researchers, and data scientists - can get their work done in their own workspaces on shared resources which can be managed efficiently by system administrators.

The Lancashire and South Cumbria Secure Data Environment uses a [customised version of the Jupyter Hub container](https://github.com/lsc-sde/docker-jupyterhub) that allows us to integrate workspace management capabilities which are embedded into the kubernetes control plane. This is supported by a [management portal](https://github.com/lsc-sde/docker-analytics-workspace-mgmt) that allows us to manage workspaces and membership to those workspaces giving us the ability to customise workspaces to individual needs of the analysis teams.
