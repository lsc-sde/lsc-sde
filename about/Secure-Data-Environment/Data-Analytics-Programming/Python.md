# Python
Python is a incredibly popular high level programming language that allows and emphasises code readability. It relies heavily on the use of python modules which are typically made available by the community on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org). 

In the Lancashire and South Cumbria Secure Data Environment we provide python developer environments via the use of [jupter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
