# What is a Secure Data Environment (SDE)
The Lancashire and South Cumbria Secure Data Environment is a secure research analysis platform.

This service gives approved researchers with approved projects secure access to NHS healthcare data. All patient information in the SDE is pseudonymised, which means that any identifying (or personal) information such as names, addresses or NHS numbers are replaced with artificial, or ‘pseudo’, information.

## Features of our SDE
* [Secure Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)](./Secure-Data-Environment/Secure-Virtual-Desktop-Infrastructure.md) 
* [Data Analytics Programming Tools](./Secure-Data-Environment/Data-Analytics-Programming.md)
* [Flexible Infrastructure](./Secure-Data-Environment/Infrastructure.md)
* [Elastic Compute Resource](./Secure-Data-Environment/Elastic-Compute-Resource.md)
* [Secure Data Ingress and Egress](./Secure-Data-Environment/Secure-Data-Ingress-and-Egress.md)
* [Roles Based Access Controls](./Secure-Data-Environment/Roles-Based-Access-Controls.md)

## Integration with the North West SDE (NWSDE)
The Lancashire and South Cumbria Secure Data Environment integrates with the [North West SDE](./Community.md) allowing researchers using the NWSDE to easily access secure compute resources while allowing our system to integrate with some of the capabilities of the NWSDE such as:

### Databricks
North West SDE Implements the [Databricks platform](https://www.databricks.com) via [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/databricks). This provides data lakehouse capabilities alongside AI and ETL capabilites. 

### Airlock capabilities
The North West SDE Implements a [Trusted Research Environment](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/access-to-health-data/trusted-research-environments/) via a customised version of [Azure TRE](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/v0.16.0/).
