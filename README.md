# Lancashire and South Cumbria Secure Data Environment
The Lancashire and South Cumbria Secure Data Environment (SDE) is a secure research analysis platform.

This service gives approved researchers with approved projects secure access to NHS healthcare data. All patient information in the SDE is pseudonymised, which means that any identifying (or personal) information such as names, addresses or NHS numbers are replaced with artificial, or ‘pseudo’, information.

[To learn more about the SDE please refer to the SDE Documentation](./about/Secure-Data-Environment.md)
