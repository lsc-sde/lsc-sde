The solution will provide a generic and flexible base for identity and access management to be supported by all applications running on the solution. 

As this capability is incredibly complicated and has already been addressed by a number of solutions, it makes sense to use an existing solution for this, in this case [Keycloak](./Identity-and-Access-Management/Keycloak.md) is the default solution that is shipped, but in theory this can be substituted for other providers.
