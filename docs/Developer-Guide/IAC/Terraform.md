[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is used to provision the infrastructure on the various cloud environments.

At present there are options to deploy into:
* [Microsoft Azure](https://github.com/lsc-sde/iac-terraform-azure)

However the solution has been left open to allow for other cloud providers in future.
