# R 
[R is a high level programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical computing and data visualization.

In the Lancashire and South Cumbria Secure Data Environment we provide R developer environments via the use of [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) made available via [jupter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
