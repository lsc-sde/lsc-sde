# Secure Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) 
The Lancashire and South Cumbria Secure Data Environment implements secure VDI infrastructure via [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and implements [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) to make these VDI's accessible to users in research organisations such as universities. These VDI's are very locked down, providing access to specific applications, including a locked-down browser to allow us to make use of additional dynamic compute resource available via [jupyter hub](https://jupyter.org/hub).
