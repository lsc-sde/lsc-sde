Getting started with the application layer of the solution is tricky when getting started as there are a number of elements involved which can be a steep learning curve for a new developer. However, once you've gotten through the initial setup as outlined in the [getting started guide](./Developer-Guide/Getting-Started.md), it should be much easier moving forwards to work on the solution.

Due to the microservice nature of the solution, you will note that there are a large number of repositories, and the number of these repositories will continue to grow as the scope of the project does. While this can give some difficulties with managing the solution, it can also make it easier for the purposes of component isolation, and if we stick to our core design principles, then many of the components will not change dramatically moving forwards.

It is also worth noting that the solution is a mix of different programming languages and capabilities, where possible we prefer to stick to python, for consistency, however on occasion it may be necessary to delve into other languages such as java where customisation of other components is required.
