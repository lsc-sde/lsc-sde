[R is a high level programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical computing and data visualization.

In the Lancashire and South Cumbria Secure Data Environment we provide R developer environments via the use of [RStudio](../IDES/RStudio.md) made available via [JupyterLab](../IDES/JupyterLab.md).
